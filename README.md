# Neon Switch

A self-contained one-touch mobile arcade game built with **Godot 4.6.x** and GDScript.

## The Game

Guide a signal orb between two neon lanes. Tap to switch lanes, avoid barriers, collect energy shards, and survive an accelerating run.

Visuals are drawn in code and sound effects are generated at runtime, so the project has no external art or audio dependency.

## Controls

- **Mobile:** primary touch anywhere
- **Desktop:** left click, Space, Enter, or keypad Enter
- **Development diagnostics:** F3

Only initial presses count. Releases, repeated key events, unrelated keys, other mouse buttons, and secondary touches are ignored.

## Open and Run

1. Install Godot 4.6.3 or a compatible Godot 4.x release.
2. Clone or download the repository.
3. Import `project.godot` in Godot.
4. Press F6/F5 or click Play.

The design baseline is 720×1280 portrait. Expanded canvas scaling supports tall phones and resizable desktop windows. The fixed 720-wide gameplay column, HUD content, neon rails, obstacles, pickups, and player are recentered whenever extra horizontal canvas appears, so the playable area no longer clings to the left side of a wide PC window.

The standalone desktop window also requests a centered initial position. The small top-left version label reads `application/config/version` from `project.godot`.

## Android Debug Build

The repository contains a secret-free **Android Debug** export preset and an automated GitHub Actions build.

```text
Package: com.elijah.neonswitch
Architecture: arm64-v8a
Output: build/android/neon-switch-debug.apk
```

The workflow installs OpenJDK 17, the Android SDK toolchain, Godot 4.6.3, matching export templates, and a disposable debug keystore before producing an installable APK and SHA-256 checksum.

Local setup, installation commands, and the hardware checklist are documented in:

```text
docs/ANDROID_VALIDATION.md
docs/ANDROID_DEVICE_TEST_REPORT.md
```

## Versioning

Every playable update increments:

```text
0.1.0-dev.N
```

The Version Guard workflow rejects playable changes that reuse the previous version.

## Architecture

- `game_balance.gd` owns gameplay tuning.
- `wave_director.gd` builds validated wave definitions.
- `save_service.gd` owns best-score persistence.
- `primary_input.gd` normalizes supported controls.
- `portrait_layout.gd` maps mobile safe areas and calculates the centered portrait column.
- `playfield_centerer.gd` applies the centered column offset to gameplay while preserving screen shake.
- `feedback_service.gd` owns generated audio, event playback, pitch variation, and mobile vibration policy.
- `debug_overlay.gd` displays a read-only runtime snapshot supplied by the game controller.
- `main.gd` coordinates game state, scoring, entities, saves, normalized input, semantic feedback, diagnostics, and deterministic run seeding.
- `background.gd` fills the active viewport while aligning rails and player-zone effects with the centered gameplay column.
- `hud.gd` builds the interface inside centered safe and content rectangles.

## Development Diagnostics

Press **F3** to toggle the runtime diagnostics panel. It displays state, seed mode, speed, spawn interval, elapsed time, lane, active entity counts, and the last accepted primary input source.

Random mode is the default. Set a non-negative seed in `project.godot` or launch with:

```text
godot --path . -- --seed=424242
```

Every run then resets the gameplay RNG to the same seed. Use `--seed=random` or `-1` in the project setting to restore random behavior.

## Audio and Haptics

`NeonFeedback` builds four streams and four `AudioStreamPlayer` nodes once at startup for start, switch, collect, and crash events.

Playback reuses those same objects. Feedback owns separate random generators, so presentation cannot alter obstacle-wave randomness. Desktop builds safely ignore haptic requests, and headless validation exercises routing without creating physical playback objects.

## Responsive Layout

The project uses `canvas_items` scaling with `expand`.

Validated layouts include:

- 720×1280 — 9:16
- 720×1560 — 9:19.5
- 720×1600 — 9:20
- 1600×900 — wide desktop validation

Tall portrait displays receive additional vertical canvas space. Wide desktop displays receive background space on both sides while the 720-wide gameplay and HUD columns remain centered.

## Automated Validation

GitHub Actions imports and parses the project with Godot 4.6.3, runs all six Godot smoke-test suites, rejects ObjectDB teardown leaks, and exports the Android debug APK.

Coverage includes the complete run loop, entity contracts, input routing, save resilience, restart stress, wave fairness, portrait geometry, centered widescreen gameplay, safe-area containment, generated-audio reuse, deterministic seeds, diagnostics, timer cancellation, and build versioning.
